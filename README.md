1. Sales Trend Over Time (January 2011 - January 2015)
   Key Observations:
* Sales data fluctuated significantly with periods of high spikes indicating peak sales times, possibly due to events, promotions, or seasonal trends.
* There was no clear upward or downward trajectory over time.

2. Profit vs Discount
   Key Observations:
*  High discounts often led to negative profits, while a cluster of low discounts showed varying profit levels, indicating smaller discounts can still achieve profitability.

4. Sales by Region
   Key Observations:
*  The West region had the highest sales, followed by East and South regions.
   Moderate sales were observed in Central, Africa, Central Asia, and Caribbean regions, while EMEA, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and Canada showed low sales.

5.  Predictive Modeling:
* The scatter plot indicated clustering around the origin, outliers, and a negative slope regression line, suggesting potential issues with the sales prediction model.
* Actionable Insights:
  - Refine the sales prediction model by re-evaluating features and parameters.
  - Investigate outliers to understand model inaccuracies
